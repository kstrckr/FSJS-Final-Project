Gameplay:

Enter your initials, these will be saved to the top 10 with your final score (assuming your Match Mastery is high enough)
After the game board loads click 2 different tiles. Clicking a 3rd tile will hide the first two if they were not a match
Matches will remain face up until you've matched all the tiles

After matching all the tiles your final score will be displaced along with a leaderboard of up to the top 10 scores recorded to the database
